# task-hero

Simple task manager with ambitious stack.
[Progressive web application](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/).

Definitely not production ready.

This is only a small personal project aimed at trying to get a neat stack to
build a progressive web application.

## Stack

### Front

- [x] ES6 
- [x] React 
- [x] Redux 
- [x] Gulp (v4.0 alpha) 
- [x] Sass
- [ ] Electron

### Back

Intending to add Node.js server with RxJS a little further down the line, before toying with
service workers.

## Dev

### Install Dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

### Launch the App with Watcher (js, sass)

```sh
npm start
```
